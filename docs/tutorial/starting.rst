Setting up the M Compiler
=========================

The M compiler does not need any special setup to work; simply clone
`The M Compiler <https://github.com/m-language/m-language>`_ in the directory
of your choice.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/m-language/m-language.git

Building the Haskell Interpreter
================================

Before building the Haskell Interpreter, you will need to install `Stack <https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/>`_:

Once Stack is installed, simply ``cd m-hs`` and ``stack run`` to run the 
interpreter.

Setting up your Editor
======================

There are M plugins for several popular editors:

- `VSCode <https://github.com/m-language/vscode-m>`_
- `Vim <https://github.com/m-language/vim-m>`_
- `IDEA <https://github.com/m-language/intellij-m>`_

If you want to add support for your favorite editor, please 
`create a feature request <https://github.com/m-language/m-language/issues/new?assignees=aedans&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D>`_.
