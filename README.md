M Language
==========

![travis build](https://travis-ci.com/m-language/m.svg?branch=master)

[The M programming language](https://m-language.github.io/) is a minimal
language primarily inspired by Lisp and Haskell, designed from the ground up to
be as simple as possible for usability and expressiveness.

For more information, an in-depth tutorial can be found
[here](https://m-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html).

Current State
-------------

M is currently in pre-alpha; some parts of the language and many parts of the
standard library are unimplemented, while others are not heavily tested or are
subject to unhelpful errors. Progress is being made every day, but there is
still a lot of work to be done, so it will be a while before the language is
easily useable.

Contributing
------------

There's a lot of work to be done on M, and any help is greatly appreciated. If
there's a feature you want to add, please open an issue and I'll help however I
can. If you want to add an editor plugin, language backend, or other tooling,
please [contact me](https://github.com/aedans) and I'll add it to the
organization.

If you want to help M succeed but don't want to contribute code, please consider
starring this repository to help others find it.
