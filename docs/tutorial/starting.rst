Choosing A Backend
==================

M has backends for many platforms, and though they can all compile the M
compiler, some provide interop with their platform that is not available with
other backends. As such, it is recommended that you build using the backend that
you are most comfortable with. If this does not matter to you, the M-JVM backend
is currently the most optimized and most stable.

Building M-JVM
==============

Before building M-JVM, you will need:

- Java version 1.8 or higher.
- Kotlin version 1.3 or higher.
- Gradle version 4.4 or higher.

Once these are installed, simply run ``./build`` or ``./build.bat`` to build
the compiler.
