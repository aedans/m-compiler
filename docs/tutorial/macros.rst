Macros

Macros are the core of M's higher level abstractions; they allow you to use
information from the compiler to modify expressions before runtime and create
new semantics. Many features in this tutorial so far have actually been macros;
for example, the ``nat`` macro, which turns a natural number into the expression
required to create it. Later in this tutorial more advanced macros will be
explored which allow things like data types, type systems, and more.
